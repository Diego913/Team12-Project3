              Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984 for the Electronika 60 computer. It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing.

              <p>Hisoka's Nen type is Transmutation, allowing him to change the type or properties of his aura. He most often uses Elastic Love - Bungee Gum (伸縮自在の愛バンジーガム, Banjī Gamu), which gives his aura the properties of both rubber and gum. He also uses Flimsy Lies - Texture Surprise (薄っぺらな嘘ドッキリテクスチャー, Dokkiri Tekusuchā), which allows him to reproduce the texture of his choice on any flat surface; such as making a handkerchief appear to be skin. Hisoka is a popular character with fans, coming in fourth and fifth place in the series' first two popularity polls.   (Wikipedia)</p>
