            Pong is a table tennis–themed arcade video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

            <p>Hisoka's Nen type is Transmutation, allowing him to change the type or properties of his aura. He most often uses Elastic Love - Bungee Gum (伸縮自在の愛バンジーガム, Banjī Gamu), which gives his aura the properties of both rubber and gum. He also uses Flimsy Lies - Texture Surprise (薄っぺらな嘘ドッキリテクスチャー, Dokkiri Tekusuchā), which allows him to reproduce the texture of his choice on any flat surface; such as making a handkerchief appear to be skin. Hisoka is a popular character with fans, coming in fourth and fifth place in the series' first two popularity polls.   (Wikipedia)</p>
